# Competitive Programming

## Strategic points to be noted till now:-

1. For each problem 1st 10 minutes should be given to understand what exactly the problem demands. After that either we have an algorithm or a direction. So basically a direction is required for each problem at the start
2. After the initial direction, we either need to implement the algorithm found or just work in the direction found(e.g. bruteforce for small values & do some manual pattern recognition, try to apply mathematical limits to input as well as output & so on)
3. Never forget to check boundary cases(i<50 or i<51?) & type limits(int/long long/big integer)
